## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

Through this project, I wanted to analyze the open-source Seattle AirBnb data to get a sense of:
1. What property types are most likely fetch a higher price per bed per night?

2. What kind of amenities tend to be provided by the property owners depending on the room type?

3. How do super hosts compare with the regular hosts?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

A Jupyter notebook named "Seattle AirBnb Analysis using CRISP-DM" has been provided that covers the work related to the above three questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@preetkamalsingh1992/seattle-airbnb-what-to-expect-on-your-next-family-trip-c3a119d4ad91)

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

I would like to give due credit to AirBnb for providing this free dataset so that the students can play around. Please find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data).
